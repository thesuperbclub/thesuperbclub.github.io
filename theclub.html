  The <font class="play-button">Superb Club</font> is a mythical organization
  emerging from a chance encounter between founders Lighting Bolt and
  Inorganic Material in a volcanic bar near Lisbon. Originally known as
  the Quarrymen, the organization emerged a few billion years later as
  the <font class="play-button">Superb Club</font> after learning how
  to play their instruments and developing a brain capable of
  (limited) self-awareness.

  You may notice that that a particularly pleasing regular quadrilateral
  shares <i>both</i> the same first letter and same number of letters
  as "superb". This, of course, is no coincidence! The most sacred of
  shapes, The Wholly Square, is intricately tied to the club's identity
  via these two powerful, shared features.
